This is a modern, responsive web layout created for my Web Application Design Lab Test. The project demonstrates a clean interface built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

The design features a sidebar, a content card, a dismissible welcome message, and a colorful interactive grid. The user can click a button to add new colored boxes to the grid and close the floating message using event listeners.
